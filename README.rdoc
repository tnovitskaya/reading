Our project is a social reading platform. Users can freely add and classify books, organize them into collections and reading lists, write reviews and flood in comments. We track their activity, providing relevant interactive graphics. On the later stages gamification elements may be added.

Team: Andrew Lelechenko and Tatyana Novitskaya.
